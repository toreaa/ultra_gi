  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SQL injection protected via parameterized queries. No sensitive data exposure. Type safety prevents common runtime errors.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Database queries use indexed lookups. Loading states prevent UI blocking. No performance concerns for MVP scope.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Error handling exists but lacks user feedback (console.error only). Should show error dialog to users.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code structure with repository pattern, proper TypeScript typing, JSDoc comments, and separation of concerns.'

      refs: ['src/database/repositories/ProgramRepository.ts:53', 'src/screens/onboarding/ProgramSuggestionScreen.tsx:72']
      rationale: 'Improve maintainability and prepare for multi-user support'

    - action: 'Align is_active type between TypeScript and database schema'
