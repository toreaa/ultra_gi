nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Soft delete pattern correctly implemented (deleted_at timestamp). Repository uses parameterized queries preventing SQL injection. Input validation reused from Story 2.2 (Zod schema). getAll() query properly filters deleted products (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL). Delete confirmation prevents accidental deletion. Product data persisted for audit trail.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Loading state with ActivityIndicator during data fetch. useEffect with proper dependency array [productId]. Form reuses validated FuelProductForm with optimized re-renders. Navigation timeout (500ms) allows toast visibility. useFocusEffect in FuelLibraryScreen ensures list refresh after edit/delete. No unnecessary re-renders.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks in all async operations. Loading state prevents premature rendering. Error state when product not found. Toast notifications for all operations (success and error). Delete dialog prevents accidental deletions. onDismiss handlers for proper dialog cleanup. Navigation safety with goBack() in error cases.'
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'Excellent component reuse of FuelProductForm from Story 2.2. initialValues and submitLabel props make form truly reusable. Clean separation of concerns (screen, form, repository). TypeScript strict typing with proper navigation types. Norwegian localization consistent. Repository methods update() and softDelete() already existed from Story 2.1. Portal + Dialog pattern for confirmation follows Material Design 3. Code structure mirrors AddFuelScreen for consistency.'

implementation_review:
  EditFuelScreen:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'Complete edit and delete screen with excellent UX. Loading state with ActivityIndicator while fetching product. Error state when product not found. Proper route params typing (EditFuelScreenProps interface). FuelProductForm reused with initialValues mapping all 5 fields correctly. submitLabel="Lagre endringer" prop passed to form. Delete button with red text color (#D32F2F) and outlined mode. Portal + Dialog for delete confirmation with proper visibility state. Snackbar for all notifications with consistent blue background (#1E88E5). handleUpdate maps form data to repository update. handleDelete performs soft delete and navigates back. handleCancel navigates back without saving. Comprehensive error handling with Norwegian error messages. ScrollView with keyboardShouldPersistTaps for mobile UX. Clean StyleSheet with loading/error/delete button styles. All 11 acceptance criteria implemented perfectly.'
  FuelStackNavigator:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'EditFuel route properly added to stack. FuelStackParamList type includes EditFuel with productId param. EditFuelScreen component imported and configured. Stack.Screen with options title. Consistent with AddFuel route setup. Clean TypeScript typing exported for use in screens.'
  FuelLibraryScreen:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'handleProductPress navigates to EditFuel with productId param. Navigation typing updated to include EditFuel route. Removed console.log placeholder (was noted in Story 2.1 QA). useFocusEffect ensures list refresh when returning from EditFuel. Clean integration with stack navigation. All ACs for navigation from list implemented.'
  FuelProductRepository:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'update() method with dynamic field building pattern (existed from Story 2.1). Handles partial updates correctly. Returns boolean for success. Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection. softDelete() sets deleted_at timestamp using datetime("now"). Returns boolean based on changes > 0. getAll() query filters WHERE deleted_at IS NULL ensuring soft-deleted products not shown. getById() used by EditFuelScreen to load product data. Comprehensive error handling with console logging. All repository operations properly implemented.'
  FuelProductForm:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'Excellent reusability design validated. initialValues prop correctly pre-populates all 5 fields. submitLabel prop defaults to "Lagre" but accepts custom labels like "Lagre endringer". No code duplication from Story 2.2. Form validation reused from Zod schema. Controller components handle all fields. Clean props interface (FuelProductFormProps). Optional serving_size and notes handled as empty strings in UI. Perfect example of component reuse without modification.'
  DeleteConfirmationDialog:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'Portal + Dialog pattern follows Material Design 3 best practices. Dialog.Title shows "Slett {product.name}?" with dynamic product name. Dialog.Content has clear warning message in Norwegian. Dialog.Actions with "Avbryt" and "Slett" buttons. Delete button with red text color (#D32F2F) for danger indication. onDismiss handler closes dialog on backdrop tap. setShowDeleteDialog state properly managed. Dialog visibility controlled by showDeleteDialog state. Clean UX with proper button spacing.'

  notes: 'Epic 2 (Fuel Management) completed successfully with excellent quality across all stories. Story 2.1 established the foundation with repository, hook, and library screen. Story 2.2 added creation capability with reusable form and validation. Story 2.3 completes the CRUD cycle with edit and soft delete functionality. Consistent architecture patterns maintained throughout: TypeScript strict typing, Norwegian localization, Material Design 3 components, parameterized queries, error handling, and loading states. Notable architectural achievement: FuelProductForm reused perfectly without modification, demonstrating excellent component design. Soft delete pattern enables data retention for audit trail while maintaining clean user experience. Epic 2 provides complete fuel product management capability ready for Epic 3 (Session Planning) integration.'
