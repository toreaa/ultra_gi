nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Zod schema validation prevents invalid data. Form validates on client before submission. Repository uses parameterized queries preventing SQL injection. Number parsing handles NaN cases safely. Optional fields properly handled as null in database.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'react-hook-form with mode: onChange for real-time validation. Form re-renders optimized via Controller. zodResolver validates efficiently. useFocusEffect refreshes product list only when screen focused. Toast with 500ms delay prevents jarring navigation.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling in form submission with try-catch. Error messages shown via Snackbar. Form disabled during submission (isSubmitting). Number field handles invalid input gracefully. Navigation back on success and cancel.'
  maintainability:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'FuelProductForm designed for reusability (Story 2.3 ready). Zod schema centralized in schemas.ts. Norwegian error messages consistent. TypeScript strict typing throughout. Proper separation of validation, form, and screen layers. Clean component structure with clear props interfaces.'

  schemas_ts:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'Centralized Zod validation schema. Norwegian error messages for all validation rules. Proper enum for product_type. Number validation with positive() and max(200). Optional fields with max length constraints. Exported FuelProductFormData type for type safety. Clean JSDoc comments.'
  FuelProductForm:
    status: EXCELLENT
    notes: 'Reusable form component with initialValues prop for edit mode (Story 2.3). react-hook-form with zodResolver integration. mode: onChange for real-time validation. All 5 fields properly controlled. HelperText displays validation errors below fields. Submit button disabled when !isValid or isSubmitting.
