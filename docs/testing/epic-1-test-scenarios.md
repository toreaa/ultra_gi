**Given** I am on the GoalsScreen
**When** I enter a goal with 4 characters: "Test"
**Then** "Neste" button should remain disabled
**And** I should see validation error: "Minst 5 tegn p√•krevd"

**When** I enter a valid goal (5+ characters): "Sub-3 maraton"
**Then** the validation error should disappear

---

### Test Scenario 1.1.6: GI Issue Validation - Required Field
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Validation

**Given** I am on the GIIssueScreen
**And** I have not selected any option
**Then** "Fullf√∏r" button should be disabled
**When** I select "Kvalme"

**And** I have entered my goal: "Sub-3 maraton Oslo 2025"
**When** I force-quit the app (simulate crash)
**And** I reopen the app
**Then** I should see the onboarding wizard again (not main app)
**And** the wizard should start from the beginning (WelcomeScreen)
**And** my progress should NOT be saved (expected behavior for incomplete onboarding)

**Rationale:** Onboarding must be completed in one session for data integrity

---

## Story 1.2: Program Suggestion

### Test Scenario 1.2.1: Program Suggestion Based on Kvalme
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Algorithm Validation

**Given** I have completed the wizard with GI issue: "Kvalme"

**And** I should see "Hvorfor dette programmet?" section
**And** the reasoning should contain: "starter med lav intensitet" or "reduserer sjansen for kvalme"
**And** I should see "Start dette programmet" button
**And** I should see "Se alle programmer" button

---

### Test Scenario 1.2.2: Program Suggestion for All GI Issues
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** Algorithm Validation

**Test each GI issue type:**

**Validation:** For MVP, all GI issues map to the same program, but reasoning is customized

---

### Test Scenario 1.2.3: Start Recommended Program
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Integration

**Given** I am on the ProgramSuggestionScreen
**And** the recommended program is "4-Week Base Carb Training"

**Expected Database State:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_programs WHERE user_id = 1;
-- Expected result:

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Data Integrity

**Given** the programs table contains "4-Week Base Carb Training"
**And** the program_sessions table contains 8 sessions for this program
**When** ProgramSuggestionScreen loads
**Then** the program details should be fetched from database
**And** all fields should be populated correctly
**And** session count should be "8 √∏kter" (2 per week √ó 4 weeks)

**Database Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM programs WHERE id = 1;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM program_sessions WHERE program_id = 1;
-- Expected: 8 sessions
```

**Expected Database State:**
```sql
SELECT name, weight_kg, onboarded_at FROM users WHERE id = 1;
-- Expected result:
-- name: 'Kari Nordmann'
-- weight_kg: 65.0
-- onboarded_at: <timestamp>

**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Type:** Persistence

**Given** I have completed onboarding
**And** I am on the MainApp
**When** I close the app completely
**And** I reopen the app
**Then** I should see the MainApp (NOT onboarding)
**And** I should see my active program on the dashboard

**When** I restart the app multiple times
**Then** onboarding should NEVER appear again
**And** the app should always open to MainApp

**Validation:** Check onboarded_at field in users table is NOT NULL

---

### Integration 1.I.3: Minimal Onboarding Flow (Skip Profile)
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Type:** End-to-End

**Given** I am a new user
**When** I execute the minimal flow:
1. WelcomeScreen ‚Üí "Kom i gang"
2. Enter goal: "Finish marathon" ‚Üí "Neste"
3. Select GI issue: "Kvalme" ‚Üí "Fullf√∏r"
4. Program recommendation ‚Üí "Start dette programmet"
5. ProfileSetupScreen ‚Üí "Hopp over"

**Then** I should reach MainApp successfully

**And** profile fields (name, weight) should be NULL

---

### Integration 1.I.4: Change Program During Onboarding
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** User Flow

**And** the recommended program is "4-Week Base Carb Training"
**When** I tap "Se alle programmer"
**And** I browse the program list
**And** I select a different program (if available)

**Acceptance:** Total time <2 minutes (120 seconds)

---

### Performance 1.P.2: Database Write Performance
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Performance

**Target:** User record creation <50ms

const start = performance.now();
await UserRepository.create({ /* user data */ });
const duration = performance.now() - start;
expect(duration).toBeLessThan(50); // ms
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Case 1.E.1: Extremely Long Goal Text
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Edge Case

**Given** I am on the GoalsScreen

---

### Edge Case 1.E.3: Back Navigation from First Screen
**Priority:** P3 (Low)
**Type:** Edge Case

**Given** I am on the WelcomeScreen (first screen)
**When** I press the device back button
**Then** the app should exit (or show exit confirmation)
**And** no navigation should occur (already at root)

---

### Edge Case 1.E.4: Rapid Button Tapping
**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Type:** Concurrency

**Given** I am on the GIIssueScreen
**And** I have selected "Kvalme"
**When** I rapidly tap "Fullf√∏r" button 5 times
**Then** only ONE user record should be created
**And** only ONE program should be started
**And** no duplicate records should exist

**Validation:** Check database for duplicate records
