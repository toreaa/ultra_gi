## üéØ Key Insights from My Analysis

### **Critical Blocker Identified:**
**B1: Dev Team Not Assigned** üî¥
- **Impact:** Cannot start Sprint 1
- **Owner:** Sarah (PO)
- **Action Required:** Assign 2-3 developers immediately

### **New Risks Identified:**
1. **R1: Epic 5 Background Timer POC** - High risk, could delay 2 weeks
2. **R2: Small Beta Sample Size** - May make metrics unreliable
3. **R3: Strava OAuth PKCE Feasibility** - Could require backend (out of scope)

### **Gap in Winston's Analysis:**
Winston (Architect) focused on **technical gaps**. I (PM) identified **product & process gaps**:
- No sprint plan (Bob's responsibility, but needed PM input)
- No success metrics (critical for measuring ROI)
- No stakeholder communication plan (PMs often forget this)

---

## üìä Updated Gap Count

### **Before My Work:**
- 10 gaps identified by Winston + Me

### **After My Work:**
- 3 gaps resolved (A1, A2, A3)
- 7 gaps remaining (see `REMAINING_GAPS.md`)

### **Remaining Critical Gaps:**
1. üî¥ Dev Team Not Assigned (Sarah - BLOCKER)
2. üî¥ Entry Point (App.tsx) (Dev Team - BLOCKER)
3. üî¥ Epic 5 Background Timer POC (Winston + Dev - HIGH RISK)

## üéØ Next Steps (Immediate)

### **For Sarah (Product Owner):**
1. **CRITICAL:** Assign 2-3 developers by end of week (BLOCKER)
2. Review ROADMAP.md - approve or adjust sprint plan
3. Review SUCCESS_METRICS.md - agree on measurement methods
4. Decide on Epic 5 POC timing (Sprint 4 or earlier?)

### **For Bob (Scrum Master):**
1. Review ROADMAP.md sprint breakdown
2. Create Definition of Done (DoD) document
3. Schedule Sprint 1 planning meeting (once devs assigned)
4. Setup daily stand-up cadence

### **For Dev Team (once assigned):**
1. Read ROADMAP.md to understand timeline
2. Run `npm install` to set up project
3. Create minimal `App.tsx` entry point (5 min)
4. Attend Sprint 1 planning

### **For Winston (Architect):**
1. Epic 5 Background Timer POC (high priority, high risk)
2. OAuth PKCE feasibility study (for Epic 6, can wait)
3. Database sizing model (low priority)

### **For Quinn (QA):**
1. Epic 1-3 Test Scenarios (2-3 days)
2. Review SUCCESS_METRICS.md - plan data collection
3. Prepare for Sprint 1 testing

### **For John (ME):**
1. ‚úÖ Product docs complete
2. Schedule Sprint 1 kickoff meeting (once devs assigned)
3. Prepare Week 1 metrics baseline
4. Begin weekly reporting cadence

## üí¨ Feedback from This Session

**What Went Well:**
- Winston's config work was excellent - nothing to add technically
- I identified 3 critical product gaps that were missed
- Created comprehensive, actionable documents (not just fluff)

**What I Learned:**
- Projects can have great architecture but poor product planning
- Communication plans are often overlooked until problems arise
- Success metrics must be defined upfront, not after launch

**Recommendations for Future Projects:**
- Product docs (Roadmap, Metrics, Comms) should come BEFORE coding
- PM + Architect should work in parallel (not sequentially)
- Always identify "who owns what" early (RACI matrix)
