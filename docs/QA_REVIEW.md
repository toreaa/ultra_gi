     Given I am a new user
     When I open the app for the first time
     Then I should see the Welcome screen
     And I should see "Kom i gang" button
   ```

2. Add edge case for "Annet" (fritekst) validation in Story 1.1
   - AC should specify: Min length, max length, sanitization

---

### Epic 2: Fuel Library (Stories 2.1-2.3)
**Quality Score:** 8.5/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Stories:**

**Issues Found:**
1. **Story 2.3:** Missing test case for "delete product that's used in active session"
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Expected behavior:** Should warn user or prevent deletion
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "If product is used in any session_events, show warning dialog before soft delete"

2. **Story 2.2:** Missing validation for duplicate product names
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "If product name already exists, show inline error"

**Recommendations:**
- Add explicit test for grouping by `product_type` in Story 2.1
- Add test for carbs_per_serving max value validation (200g)

---

### Epic 3: Programs (Stories 3.1-3.5)
**Quality Score:** 8/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Stories:**
- 3.1: Program List
- 3.2: Start Program

- ‚úÖ Clear navigation between screens

**Issues Found:**
1. **Story 3.2:** Missing validation for "user starts program when already active"
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Expected behavior:** Should warn or prevent starting second program
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "If user already has active program, show confirmation dialog"

2. **Story 3.4:** Missing definition of "progression metric"
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Current:** Vague reference to "tolerance develops over time"
   - **Recommendation:** Clarify: "Progression = Average discomfort level per session (trend line)"

**Recommendations:**
- Add explicit test for `user_programs.status = 'active'` filter in Story 3.1
- Add test for pagination if user has >10 programs (future-proofing)

---

---

### Epic 5: Session Mode (Stories 5.1-5.5) **CRITICAL**
**Quality Score:** 8/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Stories:**
- 5.1: Start Session Mode
- 5.2: Intake Notifications
- 5.3: Log Intake
- 5.4: Log Discomfort
- 5.5: End Session

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Winston's crash recovery FULLY INTEGRATED** üéâ
- ‚úÖ Auto-save every 30s correctly implemented (5.1)
- ‚úÖ Recovery metadata cleanup in 5.5 (`clearActiveSessionMetadata()`)
- ‚úÖ Background timer architecture specified
- ‚úÖ Notification permissions handling (5.2)

**CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. **‚ö†Ô∏è POC REQUIRED:** Story 5.1 correctly flags need for 4-hour background timer test
   - **Severity:** BLOCKER
   - **Recommendation:** DO NOT implement Epic 5 until POC succeeds
   - **Test:** Run `expo-task-manager` on physical Android device for 4+ hours
   - **Success criteria:** Timer accuracy ¬±10 seconds, battery drain <10%/hour

2. **Story 5.1:** Missing validation for "start session when one is already active"
   - **Severity:** High
   - **Current behavior:** Undefined (could create duplicate active sessions)
   - **Expected:** Should show RecoveryDialog or error
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "If active session exists, show recovery dialog first"

3. **Story 5.3:** Missing undo functionality for logged intake
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **User scenario:** User accidentally taps "INNTAK" button
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "Show 'Undo' toast for 5 seconds after logging"

4. **Story 5.5:** Missing handling for "end session with unsaved events"
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "Before ending, ensure auto-save completes (await last save)"

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add explicit test scenarios for crash recovery:**
   ```gherkin
   Scenario: App crashes during active session
     Given I have started a session 2 hours ago
     And I have logged 12 events
     When the app crashes
     And I reopen the app
     Then I should see RecoveryDialog
     And the dialog should show "2t 0min siden med 12 loggede hendelser"
     When I tap "Fortsett"
     Then the timer should resume at 2:00:00
     And all 12 events should be visible
   ```

2. **Add test for notification reliability:**
   - Test notifications continue when app is backgrounded
   - Test notification tap opens correct screen

3. **Add test for database transaction safety:**
   - Test auto-save doesn't interfere with manual event logging
   - Test concurrent writes (intake + discomfort logged simultaneously)

**Traceability:** ‚úÖ Excellent
- Direct references to Winston's `sessionRecovery.ts:100` (auto-save)
- Direct references to PRD `epic-5-session-mode.md#critical-testing`
- Architecture review links validated

### Epic 7: Analysis (Stories 7.1-7.7)
**Quality Score:** 8.5/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Stories:**
- 7.1: View Session Detail
- 7.2: Intake vs Discomfort Graph
- 7.3: Identify Patterns (Session Table)
- 7.4: Smart Recommendations
- 7.5: Add Session Notes
- 7.6: **NEW** Progression Graph per Program
- 7.7: **NEW** Compare Programs

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ NEW stories 7.6 and 7.7 address user feedback (progression per program)
- ‚úÖ Victory Native chart implementation specified (7.2, 7.6, 7.7)
- ‚úÖ Smart recommendations algorithm provided (7.4)
- ‚úÖ Sortable columns in 7.3

**Issues Found:**
1. **Story 7.4:** Recommendations require minimum 5 sessions, but threshold not justified
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Question:** Why 5? Statistical significance?
   - **Recommendation:** Add comment explaining threshold (e.g., "5 sessions = minimum for pattern detection")

2. **Story 7.6:** Missing handling for programs with <2 completed sessions
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Current:** Placeholder text "Fullf√∏r minst 2 √∏kter"
   - **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ Already handled, but add explicit test

3. **Story 7.7:** Missing validation for "select more than 3 programs"
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **AC says:** "Bruker velger 2-3 programmer"
   - **Recommendation:** Add AC: "Disable additional checkboxes when 3 selected"

**Recommendations:**
- Add test for normalization algorithm in 7.7 (different program lengths)
- Add test for graph rendering with extreme values (e.g., discomfort = 5 every session)
- Add test for empty state in 7.3 (no completed sessions)

**Traceability:** ‚úÖ Excellent
- SQL queries provided for aggregation (7.3, 7.6, 7.7)
- Chart implementation examples provided

---

## Cross-Epic Issues

### 1. Missing Global Error Handling
**Severity:** Medium

**Issue:** No stories explicitly handle network errors, database errors, or permission denials at app level

**Recommendation:** Add Story 0.1 (Foundation):
- Global error boundary (React error boundary)
- Toast notification system for errors
- Offline indicator (even though app is offline-first)

### 2. Missing Accessibility (a11y) Requirements
**Severity:** Low (for MVP)

**Issue:** No stories mention accessibility requirements (screen readers, font scaling, color contrast)

**Recommendation:** Defer to v1.1, but document in tech debt:
- Add a11y labels to buttons
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA
- Test with TalkBack (Android)

### 3. Missing Performance Metrics
**Severity:** Low

**Issue:** No stories specify performance targets (e.g., "session detail loads in <500ms")

**Recommendation:** Add to Definition of Done (DoD):
- All screens load in <1 second
- Database queries complete in <50ms (per PRD)
- App launch time <2 seconds

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Test Documentation
**Format:** Tasks/Subtasks only (no explicit test scenarios)

**Example from Story 1.1:**
```
- [ ] Test complete flow: Welcome ‚Üí Goals ‚Üí GI Issue ‚Üí Complete
- [ ] Test validation: Empty goal, too short goal
- [ ] Test navigation: Back button preserves state
```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Basic test tasks included in all stories
- ‚úÖ Validation tests specified

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå No Given-When-Then scenarios
- ‚ùå No test data examples
- ‚ùå No expected outputs specified

### Recommendations

**High Priority:**
1. Add explicit test scenarios to CRITICAL stories (Epic 5):
   - 5.1: Background timer accuracy
   - 5.1: Crash recovery flow
   - 5.3: Quick intake logging (<5 seconds)

**Medium Priority:**
2. Add test data examples to database-heavy stories:
   - 4.2: Fuel planner algorithm test cases
   - 7.3: Session aggregation test data

**Low Priority:**
3. Add UI/UX test scenarios:
   - Navigation flows
   - Error message visibility
   - Loading states

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Epic 5)

#### Risk 1: Background Timer Reliability
**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** CRITICAL (product-breaking)
**Mitigation:** ‚úÖ POC flagged in Story 5.1

**Details:**
- Android/iOS aggressively kill background processes
- expo-task-manager may not work for 4+ hours
- Battery drain may exceed 10%/hour

**Recommendation:**
- Run 4-hour POC on multiple Android devices
- Test on Android 10, 11, 12+ (different battery optimization policies)
- If POC fails: Consider alternative (silent audio, foreground service)

#### Risk 2: Data Loss on Crash
**Probability:** Low (10%)
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:** ‚úÖ Winston's crash recovery system

**Details:**
- Winston's auto-save runs every 30s
- Recovery dialog tested in PoC (2 hours)
- Metadata cleanup on successful end

**Recommendation:**
- Test crash recovery with force-quit
- Test crash recovery with out-of-memory kill
- Test crash recovery with battery-related kill

### Medium Risks

#### Risk 3: Fuel Planner Algorithm Accuracy
**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs explicit test cases

**Details:**
- Greedy algorithm may not find optimal solution
- Edge case: No products available
- Edge case: Products don't sum to target

**Recommendation:** Add test cases in Story 4.2:
```typescript
// Test Case 1: Exact match
availableProducts = [{ name: 'Gel', carbs: 25 }]
target = 100g
expected = [{ product: 'Gel', qty: 4, total: 100g }]

// Test Case 2: Overshoot
availableProducts = [{ name: 'Gel', carbs: 30 }]
target = 100g
expected = [{ product: 'Gel', qty: 4, total: 120g }] // 120% acceptable

// Test Case 3: Insufficient
availableProducts = [{ name: 'Gel', carbs: 25 }]
target = 100g
user has only 2 gels
expected = ERROR: "Insufficient products (50/100g)"
```

#### Risk 4: Multi-Program Confusion
**Probability:** Low (20%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs UX clarification

**Details:**
- User can have multiple active programs (Story 3.5)
- Unclear: Which program is "primary"?
- Unclear: Dashboard shows all active programs or just one?

**Recommendation:** Add to Story 3.5 AC:
- "User can set one program as 'primary' (dashboard default)"
- "Dashboard shows primary program + 'Switch' button"

### Low Risks

#### Risk 5: Victory Native Chart Performance
**Probability:** Low (10%)
**Impact:** LOW
**Mitigation:** Use data virtualization if needed

**Details:**
- Charts may lag with 100+ data points
- Victory Native is optimized for mobile

**Recommendation:** Test with 100+ sessions in Story 7.3

---

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### Missing NFRs in Stories

**Performance:**
- ‚ùå No explicit load time targets in stories
- ‚ùå No explicit animation smoothness targets
- ‚úÖ Database query targets in PRD (< 50ms)

**Usability:**
- ‚ùå No explicit "< 5 seconds per action" in stories (only in PRD)
- ‚ùå No explicit button size requirements (touch target)
- ‚úÖ Large buttons specified in Epic 5 stories

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ OAuth token storage specified (expo-secure-store)
- ‚úÖ Soft delete pattern used
- ‚ùå No explicit password/PIN requirements (deferred)

**Reliability:**
- ‚úÖ Crash recovery fully specified (Winston)
- ‚úÖ Auto-save specified (30s interval)
- ‚ùå No explicit uptime target (not applicable for offline-first)

**Recommendation:** Add NFR section to story template:
```markdown
## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: [Screen loads in <1s]
- Usability: [Action completes in <5s]
- Security: [Data encrypted at rest]
- Reliability: [99.9% crash-free rate]
```

---

## Story Template Compliance

### Template Structure (from Story 1.1)
```markdown
# Story X.Y: Title

## Status
## Story (As a/I want/So that)
## Acceptance Criteria
## Tasks / Subtasks
## Dev Notes
## Change Log
## Dev Agent Record
## QA Results
```

**Compliance:** ‚úÖ All 26 stories follow template

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent structure
- ‚úÖ "As a/I want/So that" format
- ‚úÖ Detailed tasks/subtasks
- ‚úÖ Dev notes with code examples
- ‚úÖ Change log with version tracking

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ùå "Dev Agent Record" and "QA Results" always empty (placeholder)
- ‚ùå No "Testing" section (only subtasks)
- ‚ùå No "Dependencies" section

**Recommendation:** Enhance template:
```markdown
## Dependencies
- Story X.Y must be completed first
- Requires Winston's crash recovery (src/services/sessionRecovery.ts)

## Testing Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Happy path
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected result]

### Scenario 2: Edge case
...

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: ...
- Usability: ...
```
